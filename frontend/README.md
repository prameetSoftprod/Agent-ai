# My React App

This is a simple React application built with TypeScript. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, run:
